# EAGLE-TextureMapping

This is a (maybe) wrong implementation of the paper.

## How to use

1. Make sure you have installed CUDA 10.1, PCL 1.9 with GPU (vtk 6.3), OpenCV. (I'm using Ubuntu 16.04)
2. Open the project with Qt creator, you need to edit the INCLUDE paths in eagle_textureMapping.pro file to fit your envirenment.
3. All parameters are under settings.h file, remember to change the patchmatchBinFile variable.

## About datas

The original Kinect pictures should be renamed with consistent indexs.
